# Exercises
# Create a file named seaborn_exercises.py or seaborn_exercises.ipynb
# for this exercise.
# Use seaborn's load_dataset function to load the iris database to 
# answer the following questions:

# 1. What does the distribution of petal lengths look like?
print(f'Question 1')

# 2. Is there a relationship between petal length and petal width?
print(f'Question 2')

# 3. Would it be reasonable to predict species based on sepal width
   # and sepal length? For this, you'll visualize two numeric columns 
   # through the lense of a categorical column.
print(f'Question 3')

# 4. Which features would be best used to predict species?
print(f'Question 4')

# 1. Load the anscombe dataset from seaborn. Use pandas to group the
    # data by the dataset column, and calculate summary statistics for each dataset.
    # What do you notice?
print(f'Question 1')
    # Plot the x and y values from the anscombe data. Each dataset should
    # be in a separate column.


# 2. Load the InsectSprays dataset from pydataset and read it's documentation. 
   # reate a boxplot that shows the effectiveness of the different insect sprays.
print(f'Question 2')

# 3. Load the swiss dataset from pydataset and read it's documentation. 
    # Create visualizations to answer the following questions:

    # 3a. Create an attribute named is_catholic that holds a boolean value 
    #   of whether or not the province is Catholic. (Choose a cutoff point
    #   for what constitutes catholic)
print(f'Question 3a')

    # 3b. Does whether or not a province is Catholic influence fertility?
print(f'Question 3b')

    # 3c. What measure correlates most strongly with fertility?
print(f'Question 3c')

# 4. Load the chipotle dataset from SQL, create a bar chart that shows the
   # 4 most popular items and the revenue produced by each.
print(f'Question 4')

# 5. Load the sleepstudy dataset from pydataset and read it's documentation.
   # Use seaborn to create a line chart of all the individual subject's reaction
   # times and a more prominant line showing the average change in reaction time.
print(f'Question 5')
