# Exercises
# Using the repo setup directions, setup a new local and remote repository
    # named numpy-pandas-visualization-exercises. The local version of your
    # repo should live inside of ~/codeup-data-science. This repo should be
    # named numpy-pandas-visualization-exercises

# Do your work for this exercise in a jupyter notebook named 
    # matplotlib_exercises.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# 1. Use matplotlib to plot the following equation:

    # y = x^2 − x + 2
    # You'll need to write the code that generates the x and y points.

    # Add an anotation for the point 0, 0, the origin.
print('\nQuestion 1')


# 2. Create and label 4 separate charts for the following equations
    # (choose a range for x that makes sense):

    # y = √ x
    # y = x^3
    # y = 2^x
    # y = 1 / (x + 1)

    # You can use functions from the math module to help implement
    #  some of the equations above.
print('\nQuestion 2')


# 3. Combine the figures you created in the last step into one large
    # figure with 4 subplots.
print('\nQuestion 3')


# 4. Combine the figures you created in the last step into one figure
    # where each of the 4 equations has a different color for the points.
    # Be sure to include a legend and an appropriate title for the figure.
print('\nQuestion 4')


# 5. Make a new Jupyter notebook named big_o_notation.ipynb

    # Title your chart "Big O Notation"
    # Label your x axis "Elements"
    # Label your y axis "Operations"
    # Label your curves or make a legend for the curves
    # Use LaTex notation where possible
    # Curves to graph

    # y = 0n + 1  and label the curve "O(1)"
    # y = log (n)  and label the curve "O(log n)"
    # y = n  and label the curve "O(n)"
    # y = n ∗ log (n) and label it "O(n log n)"
    # y = n^2 and label it "O(n^2)"
    # y = 2^n  and label it "O(2^n)"
    # y = n^!  and label it "O(n!)"
    # y = n^n  and label it "O(n^n)"
print('\nQuestion 5')
